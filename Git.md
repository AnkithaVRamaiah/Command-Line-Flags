### 2. **`-m` or `--message`**
   - **Usage**: Allows you to provide a commit message directly from the command line.
   - **Command**: `git commit -m "Fix bug in user login"`

### 3. **`-b` or `--branch`**
   - **Usage**: Create a new branch in the Git repository.
   - **Command**: `git checkout -b new-feature`
   - **Explanation**: This flag creates a new branch and switches to it in a single command.

### 4. **`-u` or `--set-upstream`**
   - **Usage**: Set an upstream tracking branch for a local branch.
   - **Command**: `git push -u origin new-feature`
   - **Explanation**: This flag links the local branch to the remote branch, so future pushes can be done using just `git push`.

### 5. **`-f` or `--force`**
   - **Usage**: Force Git to perform an action, even if it might be risky.
   - **Command**: `git push -f`
   - **Explanation**: This flag forces Git to overwrite changes on the remote, so be cautious when using it. Itâ€™s commonly used for rewriting history or correcting mistakes in remote branches.

### 6. **`-p` or `--prune`**
   - **Usage**: Removes references to remote branches that no longer exist.
   - **Command**: `git fetch -p`

   - **Command**: `git push -q`
   - **Explanation**: This flag suppresses the usual output, providing a cleaner, less verbose command execution.

### 11. **`--dry-run`**
   - **Usage**: Simulate an action without actually making changes.
   - **Command**: `git clean --dry-run`
   - **Explanation**: This allows you to see what will happen without actually performing the action. For example, `git clean --dry-run` will show you which untracked files would be deleted without actually deleting them.

### 12. **`-s` or `--stat`**
   - **Usage**: Show a summary of changes made in a commit or diff.
   - **Command**: `git diff -s`
   - **Explanation**: This shows a quick summary of the changes (how many lines were added or deleted) without displaying the full diff.

### Additional Git Command-Line Flags

### 16. **`--global`**
   - **Usage**: Set global configurations that apply across all repositories on your system.
   - **Command**: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
   - **Explanation**: This flag sets a configuration option for all Git repositories on your computer, like your username or email.

### 17. **`--local`**
   - **Usage**: Set configuration settings for a specific repository.
   - **Command**: `git config --local user.email "your-email@example.com"`
   - **Explanation**: This flag is used to set configurations only for the current repository, overriding global settings.

### 18. **`--rebase`**
   - **Usage**: Rebase your changes instead of merging them.
   - **Command**: `git pull --rebase`
   - **Explanation**: Instead of merging changes from the remote, this will rebase your local commits on top of the fetched changes, creating a cleaner history.

### 19. **`--squash`**
   - **Usage**: Combine multiple commits into one commit.
   - **Command**: `git merge --squash feature-branch`
   - **Explanation**: This flag is used when you want to combine all the commits from a feature branch into a single commit before merging it into the main branch.

### 20. **`--no-merges`**
   - **Usage**: Exclude merge commits from the log.
   - **Command**: `git log --no-merges`
   - **Explanation**: When viewing the commit history, this flag will hide merge commits, making it easier to see just the feature development.

### 21. **`--oneline`**
   - **Usage**: Show the commit history in a condensed, single-line format.
   - **Command**: `git log --oneline`
   - **Explanation**: This is useful for getting a quick overview of the commit history in a compact format, displaying just the commit hash and the message.

### 22. **`--graph`**
   - **Usage**: Display the commit history as a graph.

### 25. **`--no-ff`**
   - **Usage**: Ensure a merge commit is always created, even if the merge could be done with a fast-forward.
   - **Command**: `git merge --no-ff feature-branch`
   - **Explanation**: This flag forces Git to create a merge commit even when a fast-forward merge is possible, preserving the context of the feature branch.

### 26. **`--edit`**
   - **Usage**: Open the commit message editor.
   - **Command**: `git commit --edit`
   - **Explanation**: This flag forces Git to open the default text editor to modify the commit message, even if a message is already provided.

### 27. **`--hard`**
   - **Usage**: Reset the working directory and index to a specific commit, discarding all changes.
   - **Command**: `git reset --hard HEAD`
   - **Explanation**: This flag can be used to completely discard changes in your working directory and staging area, making your working directory match the specified commit.

### 28. **`--soft`**
   - **Usage**: Reset the index, but leave the working directory unchanged.
   - **Command**: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
   - **Explanation**: This resets the staging area but keeps your changes in the working directory, allowing you to make changes to the commit before re-committing.

### 29. **`--mixed`**
   - **Usage**: Reset the index but leave the working directory intact (default option).
   - **Command**: `git reset --mixed`
   - **Explanation**: Similar to `--soft`, but it resets both the index (staging area) and the commit history.

### 30. **`--no-commit`**
   - **Usage**: Prevent Git from committing after a merge.
   - **Command**: `git merge --no-commit feature-branch`
   - **Explanation**: This flag merges the branch but does not commit the merge automatically, allowing you to review and make changes before committing.

### Conclusion
These additional flags, when combined with the ones from earlier, allow for much finer control of your Git operations. Git is an extremely powerful tool, and knowing these flags can make version control easier, faster, and more efficient. You can always use `git command --help` for detailed information on any command and its available options.
