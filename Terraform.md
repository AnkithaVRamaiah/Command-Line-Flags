### General Syntax:
```
terraform <command> [options] [args]
```
Where:
- `<command>` is the specific operation you're executing, like `apply`, `plan`, `init`, etc.
- `[options]` are flags that modify the behavior.
- `[args]` are arguments, like files or directories, depending on the command.

### Common Terraform Command-Line Flags

1. **`-var`**
   - **Purpose**: Allows you to pass a variable's value directly in the command line, instead of storing it in a file.
   - **Usage**: 
     ```
     terraform apply -var "region=us-east-1"
     ```
     This sets the `region` variable to `us-east-1` during the apply step.

2. **`-var-file`**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies a file containing variables to be used in your configuration.
   - **Usage**: 
     ```
     terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"
     ```
     This applies variables defined in the `prod.tfvars` file.

3. **`-out`**
   - **Purpose**: Saves the plan output to a file so you can apply it later.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan
     ```
     This generates a plan and saves it to the `plan.tfplan` file.

4. **`-auto-approve`**
   - **Purpose**: Skips the confirmation prompt when applying a plan.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -auto-approve
     ```
     This applies the changes without asking for your confirmation.

5. **`-refresh`**
   - **Purpose**: Forces Terraform to refresh the state with the current infrastructure before applying any changes.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform plan -refresh=true
     ```
     This ensures that Terraform has the latest view of your infrastructure.

6. **`-target`**
   - **Purpose**: Targets specific resources when applying or planning, useful when you want to apply changes to a specific resource rather than the entire configuration.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -target=aws_instance.my_instance
     ```
     This applies changes only to the specified resource, `aws_instance.my_instance`.

7. **`-parallelism`**
   - **Purpose**: Controls how many resources Terraform can create, modify, or destroy concurrently. By default, Terraform runs with a parallelism of 10.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -parallelism=5
     ```
     This will limit Terraform to making 5 parallel API requests.

8. **`-state`**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies a path to a state file. Useful if you're working with multiple state files.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform plan -state=state.tfstate
     ```
     This uses the state file `state.tfstate` for planning.

9. **`-input`**
   - **Purpose**: Controls whether Terraform asks for user input during execution. By default, Terraform asks for input if it's missing from the configuration.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -input=false
     ```
     This prevents Terraform from asking for input and is often used in automated scripts.

10. **`-lock`**
    - **Purpose**: Prevents or allows locking of the state file during operations. This is useful in collaborative environments.
    - **Usage**:
      ```
      terraform apply -lock=false
      ```
      This disables state file locking, useful if you need to perform operations without waiting for a lock.

11. **`-lock-timeout`**
    - **Purpose**: Specifies how long Terraform should wait to acquire a lock on the state file before timing out.
    - **Usage**:
      ```
      terraform apply -lock-timeout=5m
      ```
      This makes Terraform wait for up to 5 minutes to acquire the lock on the state file.

12. **`-no-color`**
    - **Purpose**: Disables colored output, useful for logging or when running Terraform in environments that don't support colors.
    - **Usage**:
      ```
      terraform apply -no-color
      ```
      This ensures that Terraform outputs plain text without any colors.

13. **`-help`**
    - **Purpose**: Displays help for a specific command or the general Terraform CLI.
    - **Usage**:
      ```
      terraform apply -help
      ```
      This shows the available options for the `apply` command.

14. **`-verify-plugins`**
    - **Purpose**: Ensures the plugins (providers) used in your Terraform configuration are valid and haven’t been tampered with.
    - **Usage**:
      ```
      terraform init -verify-plugins=true
      ```
      This helps increase security by checking plugin integrity.

15. **`-json`**
    - **Purpose**: Outputs Terraform commands' results in JSON format, useful for processing the output programmatically.
    - **Usage**:
      ```
      terraform plan -json
      ```
      This outputs the plan results in JSON format.

### Example Use Case:
1. **Creating Infrastructure**:
   You might use `terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file="dev.tfvars"` to apply changes from a `dev.tfvars` file without confirming each change.
   
2. **Refreshing State**:
   When you want Terraform to ensure the infrastructure is up-to-date with the real world, you might use `terraform plan -refresh=true`.

### Additional Terraform Command-Line Flags

16. **`-lock-timeout`**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the duration Terraform will wait to acquire a lock on the state file before it gives up.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -lock-timeout=30s
     ```
     This waits for 30 seconds before giving up on acquiring a state lock.

17. **`-module-depth`**
   - **Purpose**: Controls how deep Terraform will show the module stack in the plan output.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform plan -module-depth=2
     ```
     This limits the depth of module nesting to 2 levels.

18. **`-target`**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies individual resources to apply instead of applying everything defined in your configuration.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -target=aws_instance.my_instance
     ```
     This applies changes only to the specified instance (`aws_instance.my_instance`).

19. **`-input`**
   - **Purpose**: Disables interactive input. By default, Terraform asks for user input if it’s required for a plan or apply.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -input=false
     ```
     This prevents Terraform from prompting for any input, often used in automated scripts.

20. **`-module`**
   - **Purpose**: Allows you to specify a particular module in your plan or apply command.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -module=module.name
     ```

21. **`-no-color`**
   - **Purpose**: Disables colored output (useful for non-terminal environments or when logging Terraform outputs).
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -no-color
     ```

22. **`-state-out`**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies an alternate output file for state files. This is helpful when working with remote state configurations.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -state-out=terraform-prod.tfstate
     ```

23. **`-validate`**
   - **Purpose**: Validates the configuration before applying any changes to ensure the syntax and setup are correct.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -validate=true
     ```

24. **`-detailed-exitcode`**
   - **Purpose**: Modifies the exit code behavior, where Terraform returns `2` if there are changes and `0` if no changes are made.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform plan -detailed-exitcode
     ```

25. **`-plan`**
   - **Purpose**: Allows specifying a path to an existing plan file, which you can apply later.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform apply -plan=planfile.tfplan
     ```
     This applies a previously generated plan from `planfile.tfplan`.

26. **`-upgrade`**
   - **Purpose**: Upgrades the Terraform version used by a provider.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform init -upgrade
     ```
     This upgrades the provider versions to the latest available versions.

27. **`-verify-plugins`**
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that the providers and plugins are verified before usage.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform init -verify-plugins=true
     ```

28. **`-force-copy`**
   - **Purpose**: Forces the state to be copied to a new file during operations like `terraform state mv`.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform state mv -force-copy
     ```

29. **`-no-destroy`**
   - **Purpose**: Prevents Terraform from destroying any resources.
   - **Usage**:
     ```
     terraform destroy -no-destroy
     ```

### Example Workflow
- **Creating and applying changes**:
   ```
   terraform plan -var-file="prod.tfvars" -out=prod_plan.tfplan
   terraform apply prod_plan.tfplan
   ```

- **Refreshing the state before applying changes**:
   ```
   terraform plan -refresh=true
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

- **Using a module-specific flag**:
   ```
   terraform plan -module-depth=2
   ```
